== Deploying a Babylon Dark Tower Cluster

Overview

This document outlines deploying the Dark Tower backend(s) for the Babylon project. So named as they can be deployed and run completely lights out without any manual configuration "lighting up" the Ansible Tower front end.

* Your own Dark Tower test/dev/prod infrastructure
** Single tower server
** Cluster

NOTE: Dark Tower can be deployed on a global scale using peered VPCs on AWS on top of this link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/tree/development/ansible/configs/multi-region-example[AgnosticD configuration]. This is not covered in this document which serves as a Quick Start guide.

A Babylon Dark Tower cluster is an link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/tree/development/ansible/configs/ansible-tower[AgnosticD Config] with the necessary vars outlined below. 

=== Pre-requisites

* A host capable and configured for running Ansible
* AWS Credentials
* An Ansible Tower License

==== Step 1 - Creating your Own Dark Tower Server or Cluster

. If necessary clone or pull link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd.git[AgnosticD]
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd.git
----
. Change directory into `agnosticd/ansible`
+
[source,bash]
----
cd agnosticd/ansible
----

. Find the latest `ansible-tower-prod` tag:
+
[source,bash]
----
git tag -l "ansible-tower-prod*" | sort --version-sort | tail -1
----
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-tower-prod-0.3
----
+
[source,bash]
----
. Checkout the highest/latest revision
git checkout <OUTPUT-OF-THE-PRIOR-COMMAND>
----


==== Preparing the Sample Vars files(s)

The typical way to deploy an AgnosticD config from a control host or laptop is to invoke it with 1, or ideally 2, var files.

NOTE: It is recommeded that you use 2 var files to seperate confidential information such as creds from configuration inofrmation which can be shared freely. That is the pattern we will use here:

+
[source,bash]
----
 ansible-playbook main.yml \
-e @~/dark-tower-vars.yml \
-e @~/secret-vars.yml
----


. Prepare a `yaml` based variable file
