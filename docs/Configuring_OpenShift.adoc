See link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/babylon/tree/master/openshift/config[openshift/config readme].

== Manual

. Install link:https://github.com/redhat-gpte-devopsautomation/anarchy-operator.git[Anarchy - OpenShift Operator for Stateless API operations]
. Install link:https://github.com/redhat-gpte-devopsautomation/poolboy.git[Poolboy - OpenShift Operator to manage OpenShift resources]

.. Add SSH private key as secret if any (see readme)
.. Authorized SSH key in your git repo (settings/deploy key in github)
.. Add agnosticvRepo(s) custom resource
. Create secrets in `anarchy-operator` namespace (ex: AWS creds, repo urls, ...)
. Cleanup OpenShift templates: If like us, you don't want to have all the default OpenShift Templates showing up in the Catalog, but only items populated by agnosticv-operator, then run the following:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc delete template -n openshift --all
----
